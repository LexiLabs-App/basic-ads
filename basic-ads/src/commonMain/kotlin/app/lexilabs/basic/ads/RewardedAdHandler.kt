/**
 * An [RewardedAdHandler] is a full-screen ad that cover the interface of the host app.
 * They're typically displayed at natural transition points in the flow of an app,
 * such as between activities or during the pause between levels in a game.
 * When an app shows an rewarded ad, the user has the choice to either tap on
 * the ad and continue to its destination or close it and return to the app.
 *
 * @param activity Android required Activity
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * // Instantiate
 * val ad = RewardedAd(activity)
 * // Load the Ad
 * ad.load(
 *   adUnitId = "AD_UNIT_ID_GOES_HERE", // Rewarded Ad Unit ID from AdMob
 *   onLoad = {
 *   // ad.setListeners could go here instead
 *   },
 *   onFailure = {  } // Callback when ad fails to load
 * )
 * // (optional) Observe what happens to the ad after it's shown
 * ad.setListeners(
 *   onFailure = {}, // Callback when ad fails to display
 *   onDismissed = {}, // Callback when ad is dismissed
 *   onShown = {}, // Callback after ad is shown
 *   onImpression = {}, // Callback after the ad makes an impression
 *   onClick = {} // Callback on ad click
 * )
 * // Show the ad
 * ad.show()
