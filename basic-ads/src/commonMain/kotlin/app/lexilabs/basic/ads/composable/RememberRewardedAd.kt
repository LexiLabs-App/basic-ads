/**
 * Remembers a [RewardedAdHandler], which is used to load and show rewarded ads.
 *
 * This function will automatically attempt to load an ad when the [RewardedAdHandler.state]
 * is [AdState.NONE] or [AdState.DISMISSED].
 *
 * @param activity The activity to use for loading and showing the ad. This should be an Android `Activity`.
 * @param adUnitId The ad unit ID to use for loading the ad. Defaults to [AdUnitId.REWARDED_DEFAULT].
 * @param onLoad A callback that will be invoked when the ad has successfully loaded.
 * @param onFailure A callback that will be invoked if the ad fails to load, providing an [Exception] with details of the failure.
 * @return A [MutableState] holding the [RewardedAdHandler]. You can observe this state to react to changes in the ad's lifecycle.
